			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>RATIONALE_1:</b> Using two distinct (complementary ) colors effectrively separted the populations into the two years in question. </li>
				<li><b> RATIONALE_2:</b> I wanted to set the bars horizontally and opposed to each other to allow for size comparison in a given 
					age group. However, The fact the bars are opposite to each other makes it difficult to compare their sizes.</li>
				<li><b>RATIONALE_3:</b> Starting at younger ages at the top was a decision that would illustrate how population seems to decay
					 almost steadily with age, inspite of the hundred year difference between both groups. This effect was effective as seen by the 
					 inverted pyramid shape formed by the data. I definetly wanted to just show the nature of human life-span: fading as age goes by.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>RATIONALE_1:</b> Placing the bars on top of each other was done to emphasize the size difference between the age groups 
					which is a lot more effective than in Sketch One.</li> 
				<li><b> RATIONALE_2:</b> I thought the very distint colors worked well on my First Sketch, so I repeated this design choice. </li>
				<li><b>RATIONALE_3:</b>  Instead of including a single number to represent the five year bins, I decided to include the bins 
				with the range they represnet labeled. Hopefully this reduces confussion on the average consumer of this graphic who would not have 
			access to my annotations.</li>
				
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>RATIONALE_1:</b> Though we were warned during the first couple weeks that area  does not always convey infomration well, I wanted
				to try to make square in order to highlight how much larger the male population is in the year 2000 when compared to a hundred years prior. 
			I would say the size difference between the different census years was effectively shown with the aqure shapes.</li>
				<li><b>RATIONALE_2:</b> A challenge throughout the design process of visulizations has been to handle all the different age groups. This Visualization
				definetly seems crowded, so unless it was viewed on some digital media, it would probabbly not be very effective.</li>
				<li><b>RATIONALE_3: </b>The legend creation is what communicates the number of people represented by these squares. If this legend is not understood, 
					the whole visual is probably quite unclear. While it was tempting to leave the legend with minimal text, I eflt like a sentence explanation of the legend 
				will aid readers.</li>
				<li><b>RATIONALE_4:</b> The colors represent the two different years of census data being presented. Instead of having a 
					legend explaining the color, I used the title and the text color to implicitly indicate which color correspond to which 
				group. </li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        I decided to use my three different sketches as mini-iterations of one another. Meaning I tried to extract the things that worked 
		from one sketch onto another. I know undestand my job is to make sure a reader can understand the data without necessarily spending
		a lot of time with a data set. This gives me a lot of power as to how to tell the data's story. I strive to make my visulaizations 
		as objective as possible, but I am sure in the real world, it depeneds on the field I am in. I am guessing depending on the 
		sitaution I am in, I will design with more specfifc goals.<b>A data vizualization does not seem to be any different form other 
		meaens of written communication: you control the story. </b>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        The first decison I made was to use Tableau, since it could provide a professional, clean look to my visualization. For the visualization's 
		title, I opted for a font that would give a newspaper look. After several iterations, I decided to use the <i>Toppan Bunkyu Midashi Gothic</i> font. 
		Unlike the protoype visuals, I wanted the final visualization one to communicate the difference in age distribution in the two seprate years, rather than their 
		relative size differences. Meaning the shape of the populations is more important than thier size. Therefore, the two different populations have different axes, 
		wich places more emphasis on the distribution shapes. </p>
		<p> The colors for this visulaization were chosen to be de different and easily visible--similar to the sketches. However, unlike the sketches, I picked colors that 
			were less jarring. This goal led me to choos red and peach color which look differnet, but do not draw as much attention as a neon color would.
			The legend and text explanation were added to the side in order to aid the reader undesrtand the visualizations properly, and pay attention to the two different axes scales. 
			The annotations were placed to the right of the chart in order to let the visualization breath and not feel crowded. Finally, while the raw data simply had 
			numbers to distinguish between age groups, I decided to substitiute the numbers for the ranges they represent. Similar to the first sketch, this vizualization starts with younger 
			age groups on top in order to emphasize the decaying nature of human life-span, regardless of what century we look at.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The final delivery for this assignmnet was a static image, that is one of the few constraints in 
		the assignment. This lack of specificity allowed me to be creative with the tools I used. Using Notability for my sketches
		Tableau for the final visual was really fun, as it allowed me to really appreciate how one is good for idea generation
		adn the other is good for idea presentation, respectively. Additionally, as mentioned on the sketch reflection, I now understand
		the design choices I make will have a narrative impact on the reader. I tried showing 
		my different sketches to different people without providing much explantion of background, and the takeways they got were very diffeent 
		depending on what design choices I made were. Overall, I thought this was a pretty infomrative assignment to complete, as it not only 
		allwed me to practice my data-handling skills, but also practice my design skills.
